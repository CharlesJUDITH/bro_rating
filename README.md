# Bro rating

A lot of new users are asking in chat : "What is the best validator to stake and WHY?!"
We want to introduce our BRO rating. We want to put into this rating only measurable metrics:

**I suggest to use linear proportion, first place get max point, the last one 0. Validator in the middle will get 50% of points.**
**Feedback**

1. Government  participation (Max 20 points)

This category will check validators in government involvement. Rating will track last 10 proposals. Who was gotten participation in all proposals will get max points.

2. Pre-commit (Max 45 points)

This category will check validators uptime. Who had the best uptime will get max points.

3. Voting power (Max 15 points)

**To discuss**: This category will check validators voting power. The more stake you have the more/less point you will have. (To lead for decentralisation)

4. Self stake (Max 5 points)

This category will check validators self delegation. The more you have, the more points you will get.

5. Commission (Max 15 points)

This category will check validators commission. The bigger commission you have, the less points you will get.

Max point (100) will have validator who will be on the top of all categories.

All of these categories show your resposibility (Government  participation), reliability (Pre-commit), power (Voting power) , interest (Self stake) , generosity (Commission).

These parameters are valuable for chain consensistenty and their "power" can be discussed, but for now we want to stay with such metrics/points.

We can't measure any contributions to add them to this list, for everything else we have Mastercard :)
