    "There are no top limits for self-delegation, so for calculations will be used proportion between self delegated tokens max self delegated tokens in the active validator set. This proportion will be multiplied by the maximum value of this criterion or 13 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Min self delegation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the initial param of the `create validator` transaction. It helps understand possible behavior ways of the validator in the future. The operator can't self-delegate fewer tokens than was set in the current param. Hence, this criterion shows seriousness in the manner of the long-term validating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, this criterion is controversial,  because few validators really thinking about its importance. To avoid any discussions was decided to allocate only 3 points for that discipline and calculate it by `order-average` scheme, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "validators will be sorted by the min self delegation parameter descending, the order places will be distributed (places can be the same), and points will be distributed descending from 3 to 3 divided on validators number (step). In the case of the same order places the average value will get.\n",

This criterion was estimated to be 10 points because, on the one hand, it is very representative but on another, a lot of delegations were added only by zero-fee ads, moreover a lot of delegations from the foundation. To avoid centralization voting power criterion was moved to the background.\n",
